# Embedded_Systms_Scope

## Project overview

Repository for CSE-60685-CX-01 Machine Learning for Embedded Systems

Communication channels: [https://discord.gg/Sa6tGvS4]

Models: MobileNet v2 [https://paperswithcode.com/method/mobilenetv2]

Datasets: COCO + [BDD100k](https://www.vis.xyz/bdd100k/)

Detection of objects, estimate distance -> local minima -> where distance triggers program to send warning to speaker on PI

## Sprint 1 Goals

- Model trained on COCO + fine tuned for BDD100K
- Implement on PI
- Prove detection works
